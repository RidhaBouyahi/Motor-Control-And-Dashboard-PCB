# Motor Control And Dashboard PCB
 
 This Dashboard PCB is developed to get data (position,temperature...) from sensors, control actuators and Dc Motor direction  and speed control using PWM .
All of these with the use of a touch panel screen connected to the board to make it easy for the user to operate and command everything with a simple touch.
The dimension of the PCB is 82.5*64 (mm)
It features : 
* Built-in H Bridge for speed and direction control.
* Reverse Current Protection Circuit.
* AVR-SPI Programmer. 
* UART for serial communications. 
* 4 digital and 5 Analog pins.
